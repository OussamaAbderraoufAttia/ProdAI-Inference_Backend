# ProdAI - ReAct Agent Architecture Design

## Overview
ProdAI is an AI-driven multi-agent system designed to optimize production, sales, and logistics. It enables automated decision-making, real-time KPI monitoring, and adaptive planning to enhance operational efficiency.

## Core Components
- **Agents:** Sales, Production, and Logistics agents, each with:
  - State Manager
  - Plan Generator
  - Action Executor
  - Communication Interface
  - Decision Engine
- **Shared KPI Framework:** Tracks efficiency, output, quality, and costs.
- **Communication Protocol:** Agents exchange STATUS_UPDATE, ALERT, PLAN_PROPOSAL, and more.

## Decision & Planning
- Agents analyze KPIs, detect issues, and propose solutions.
- Multi-agent collaboration ensures optimal decision-making.
- Simulations evaluate potential outcomes before execution.

## Emergency Handling
- Critical situations trigger automated response levels.
- Escalation to human intervention when necessary.

## Implementation Phases
1. **Core Framework:** Basic agent structure, KPI tracking.
2. **Enhanced Intelligence:** Advanced planning, learning.
3. **Full Automation:** Autonomous decision-making, adaptation.

ProdAI streamlines industrial operations through AI-powered automation, enhancing efficiency and decision-making across production, sales, and logistics.
